I also briefly\n            made <b>user personas</b>, but decided not to go forward with them\n            as I didn't feel they added value or focus to my synthesis of the\n            problem, considering they were largely drawn from my user\n            interviews, which were already few in number and focused on a small\n            group of very specific characters.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            My process documentation also suggested that, after my initial\n            brainstorm of changes, I was going to focus on an improved\n            onboarding experience to encourage use or at least understanding of\n            all the app's features. However, after remapping the app's\n            navigation and redesigning the UI to be more intuitive and invite\n            curiosity, I felt that the specific onboarding experience I had\n            originally sketched out seemed less necessary.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Going forward conceptually, I wanted to look into the UI/UX aspect\n            of the design with more depth, and target the fringe users who I\n            weren't able to conduct research with. Specifically, I'd like to\n            revise my design to have better visibility, contrast, and be more\n            friendly towards elderly immigrant patrons with potential language\n            options. Many of the Chinese immigrant grandparents in East Auckland\n            suburbs ride buses frequently, and during one user interview we\n            discussed an instance of another bus rider asking the interviewee to\n            translate the app instructions for her. This is something I'm\n            enthusiastic about looking into.{' '}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As for the next steps in the process, I'd like to get feedback from\n            potential users and conduct tests to understand the effectiveness of\n            my proposed changes, as well as discuss the feasibility of my\n            technical proposes with Auckland Transport developers. I'd also like\n            to spend more time gaining stronger prototyping skills!\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <Footer />\n    </main>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ATMobile;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/big-frame.af9c06f0.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/big-frame-mobile.862b7449.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sol-1.3127074d.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sol-2.eae1b224.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sol-3.60b1e6a1.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sol-4.65993e47.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/ProAct-logo.e1f2e8df.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/proact-mobile.52fe9271.png\";","/* eslint-disable react/jsx-no-target-blank */\nimport { React, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport './styles/desproj.css';\nimport cover from './images/work/proact/proact-coverimage.png';\nimport desktop from './images/work/proact/big-frame.png';\nimport mobile from './images/work/proact/big-frame-mobile.png';\nimport sol1 from './images/work/proact/sol-1.png';\nimport sol2 from './images/work/proact/sol-2.png';\nimport sol3 from './images/work/proact/sol-3.png';\nimport sol4 from './images/work/proact/sol-4.png';\nimport logo from './images/work/proact/ProAct-logo.png';\nimport mobilemockup from './images/work/proact/proact-mobile.png';\nimport Footer from './components/footer';\nimport Navbar from './components/navbar';\n\nimport AOS from 'aos';\nimport 'aos/dist/aos.css';\n\nconst ProAct = () => {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    AOS.init({\n      duration: 1000,\n    });\n  }, []);\n  return (\n    <main className='desproj'>\n      <title>about Isabel 🖍️</title>\n      <Navbar />\n\n      <div className='desproj-container'>\n        <div className='desproj-coverimage'>\n          <img src={cover} alt='Cover'></img>\n        </div>\n        <div className='desproj-titlebox'>\n          <div className='desproj-title'>\n            <h5>\n              ProAct:\n              <br />\n              Disaster Response Dashboard\n            </h5>\n          </div>\n          <div className='desproj-details'>\n            <h6>Team:</h6>In collaboration with Mun Joon Teo, Winny Jiang, and\n            Zi Lin Wang. <p />\n            Responsible for collaborative product design and pitching.\n            <p>\n              <h6>Tools:</h6> Figma, Illustrator\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <h6>Timeline:</h6> 24h, 16-17 Jan 2021\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div /* data-aos='fade-up' */ className='desproj-content'>\n          <div className='desproj-tagline'>\n            Championing quality disaster response design and child welfare.\n          </div>\n          <div className='desproj-container'>\n            <p>\n              Our web dashboard and companion mobile app design were produced\n              for the 2021 Accenture #HackForGood hackathon challenge.

I was mostly an artist, who also liked\n                communications and journalism work. It seemed like a last-minute\n                decision I made in Year 13, but in reality, I'd experienced a\n                profound change in how I saw technology, which sparked the\n                trajectory of my new career goals.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Creative software was crucial to my art and design arsenal.\n                Marketing and communications depended on social media. Even\n                keeping connected meant conversations and collaboration online.\n                I viewed softwares as tools which had a great impact on my\n                inspiration and ability to do the things I was passionate about;\n                making art, and uplifting communities.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                This led my pivot to computer science: I want to make digital\n                products which enables others to pursue creativity and hearten\n                their communities too.

Now, take a look at this\n                website I've handcoded, or some of{' '}\n                <a href='http://isabel.li/work' target='_blank'>\n                  my recent projects\n                </a>\n                , and see how much I've been proud to learn! The past year has\n                been a lot of reckoning the unfamiliar, but that in itself is\n                nothing new.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Whether it's picking up the bandsaw or creating motion graphics\n                for the first time, I dive right in with the mindset that{' '}\n                <b>I can do it</b>, even if that means expending time and effort\n                to broaden my comfort zone, or not getting it right the first\n                time. I have the capacity to learn anything — it's up to me to\n                take the initative, and put in the work.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                I'm sure that taking a role at Canva means I'll be challenged to\n                grow and encounter things I've never done before.

The marriage of\n                these two ideas - of more ‘abstract’ issues often being\n                truncated in their perceived emotional effect, and of public\n                voices dominating the the attention economy - lends the thought\n                that as youth grow with a digital, inherently intangible\n                component to their lives, their private problems and underlying\n                emotions dip further into obscurity. It aligns with my\n                experiences on the local youth council this year as we grapple\n                with confronting contemporary youth issues, which I’ve\n                discovered are more to do with feeling unheard and uncertain\n                than practical problems with visible solutions. It brings to\n                mind this year’s theme of our annual youth week: we are more\n                than you see.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <p>\n            It’s impossible not to consider the role of online platforms in\n            producing this culture of smothered silence. Those who don’t use\n            social media as extensively as our youth do today (and it must be\n            noted that social media serves as a vessel for regular aspects of\n            our lives, not a vague, foreign intrusion which replaces and\n            distracts from the now!) often mistake the ubiquity of these\n            platforms as an expansion of opportunities for us to express\n            ourselves. My own personal assessment of my experiences online,\n            especially as a young artist interested in growing an audience,\n            networking, and reaching others through my work, suggests that the\n            ever-expanding digital universe only makes it easier for our voices\n            to be projected into a vacuum. To be (or arguably more importantly,\n            feel) heard is not simply to have the space to speak, but to be\n            heard above everyone else - and in a digital world which lends to\n            infinitely many voices, a world saturated in noise, we often feel\n            smaller than ever.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>MY INTENT</b> is to present the modern context of youth\n            expression, and a study of its suppression and distortion. Without a\n            physical form our voices and opinions seem brittle, but the\n            simmering emotions beneath the surface must be recognised as equally\n            potent, and equally powerful, as those which take form in riots,\n            vandalism, and violence.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <Footer />\n    </main>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Audacity;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/art13.41ea0ffb.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/installation.859e5e8d.png\";","import { React, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport './styles/desproj.css';\nimport cover from './images/work/horizon/thumb.png';\nimport Footer from './components/footer';\nimport Navbar from './components/navbar';\n\nimport AOS from 'aos';\nimport 'aos/dist/aos.css';\n\nconst Horizon = () => {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    AOS.init({\n      duration: 1000,\n    });\n  }, []);\n  return (\n    <main className='desproj'>\n      <title>Horizon</title>\n      <Navbar />\n\n      <div className='desproj-container'>\n        <div className='desproj-coverimage'>\n          <img src={cover} alt='Cover'></img>\n        </div>\n        <div className='desproj-titlebox'>\n          <div className='desproj-title'>\n            <h5>\n              Horizon:\n              <br />\n              An In-Flight Travel Companion\n            </h5>\n          </div>\n          <div className='desproj-details'>\n            <h6>Team:</h6>In collaboration with Julia Wang for Adobe Creative\n            Jam x Southwest Airlines. 2nd place. <p />\n            <p>\n              <h6>Tools:</h6> Adobe XD.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <h6>Timeline:</h6> 20 - 27 May 2021.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div /* data-aos='fade-up' */ className='desproj-content'>\n          <div className='desproj-tagline'>\n            With what seems like the end of quarantine in sight, people are\n            yearning to move around and travel. <br /> <br />\n            Whether it’s to meet friends and family or to expand horizons, our\n            app provides a fun and relaxing way for passengers to find a deeper\n            connection and understanding of their destination.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n          </div>\n          <div className='desproj-container'>\n            <div\n              className='horizon-prototype'\n              styles={{ borderRadius: '10px' }}\n            >\n              <iframe\n                width='768'\n                height='1024'\n                src='https://xd.adobe.com/embed/464db581-999d-4160-8fe2-87d744c480f2-131e/'\n                frameborder='20'\n                allowfullscreen\n                style={{\n                  borderRadius: '20px',\n                  borderStyle: 'solid 5px #000000',\n                }}\n              ></iframe>{' '}\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <br />\n              <p>\n                Horizon is an in-flight companion for travelers offering\n                exploration, entertainment, and education about their\n                destination.
