I was also able\n                  to easily ask follow up questions or discover more about their\n                  experience in detail.\n                </li>\n              </ul>\n            </span>\n            I decided not to send out user surveys as they wouldn’t offer any\n            different insights to the user interviews, and it would not have\n            been realistic to expect many responses within the one day I had\n            allocated for research.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I also considered analysis of standalone comments and opinions\n            posted on social media, but a quick search showed that the limited\n            comments I did find were scarce in detail and not particularly\n            meaningful.\n          </p>\n          <div className='desproj-subheader'>App Reviews</div>\n          <p>\n            I looked to app reviews on both the Google Play Store and iOS App\n            Store to find user input on the app’s usability.

I also briefly\n            made <b>user personas</b>, but decided not to go forward with them\n            as I didn't feel they added value or focus to my synthesis of the\n            problem, considering they were largely drawn from my user\n            interviews, which were already few in number and focused on a small\n            group of very specific characters.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            My process documentation also suggested that, after my initial\n            brainstorm of changes, I was going to focus on an improved\n            onboarding experience to encourage use or at least understanding of\n            all the app's features. However, after remapping the app's\n            navigation and redesigning the UI to be more intuitive and invite\n            curiosity, I felt that the specific onboarding experience I had\n            originally sketched out seemed less necessary.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Going forward conceptually, I wanted to look into the UI/UX aspect\n            of the design with more depth, and target the fringe users who I\n            weren't able to conduct research with. Specifically, I'd like to\n            revise my design to have better visibility, contrast, and be more\n            friendly towards elderly immigrant patrons with potential language\n            options. Many of the Chinese immigrant grandparents in East Auckland\n            suburbs ride buses frequently, and during one user interview we\n            discussed an instance of another bus rider asking the interviewee to\n            translate the app instructions for her. This is something I'm\n            enthusiastic about looking into.{' '}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As for the next steps in the process, I'd like to get feedback from\n            potential users and conduct tests to understand the effectiveness of\n            my proposed changes, as well as discuss the feasibility of my\n            technical proposes with Auckland Transport developers. I'd also like\n            to spend more time gaining stronger prototyping skills!\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <Socials />\n      <Footer />\n    </main>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ATMobile;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/proact-coverimage.837b6e1d.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/big-frame.af9c06f0.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/big-frame-mobile.44a37022.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sol-1.392257ec.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sol-2.958b4e24.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sol-3.943e6a6c.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/sol-4.6010eefb.png\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/ProAct-logo.e1f2e8df.png\";","/* eslint-disable react/jsx-no-target-blank */\nimport { React, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport './styles/desproj.css';\nimport cover from './images/work/proact/proact-coverimage.png';\nimport desktop from './images/work/proact/big-frame.png';\nimport mobile from './images/work/proact/big-frame-mobile.png';\nimport sol1 from './images/work/proact/sol-1.png';\nimport sol2 from './images/work/proact/sol-2.png';\nimport sol3 from './images/work/proact/sol-3.png';\nimport sol4 from './images/work/proact/sol-4.png';\nimport logo from './images/work/proact/ProAct-logo.png';\nimport Footer from './components/footer';\nimport Navbar from './components/navbar';\nimport Socials from './components/socials';\nimport AOS from 'aos';\nimport 'aos/dist/aos.css';\n\nconst ProAct = () => {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    AOS.init({\n      duration: 1000,\n    });\n  }, []);\n  return (\n    <main className='desproj'>\n      <title>about Isabel 🖍️</title>\n      <Navbar />\n\n      <div className='desproj-container'>\n        <div className='desproj-coverimage'>\n          <img src={cover} alt='Cover'></img>\n        </div>\n        <div className='desproj-titlebox'>\n          <div className='desproj-title'>\n            <h5>\n              ProAct:\n              <br />\n              Disaster Response Dashboard\n            </h5>\n          </div>\n          <div className='desproj-details'>\n            <h6>Team:</h6>In collaboration with Mun Joon Teo, Winny Jiang, and\n            Zi Lin Wang. <p />\n            Responsible for product design and pitching.\n            <p>\n              <h6>Tools:</h6> Figma, Illustrator\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <h6>Timeline:</h6> 24h, 16-17 Jan 2021\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div data-aos='fade-up' className='desproj-content'>\n          <div className='desproj-tagline'>\n            Championing quality disaster response design and child welfare.\n          </div>\n          <div className='desproj-2col'>\n            <p>\n              Our web dashboard and companion mobile app design were produced\n              for the 2021 Accenture #HackForGood hackathon challenge.

The marriage of\n                these two ideas - of more ‘abstract’ issues often being\n                truncated in their perceived emotional effect, and of public\n                voices dominating the the attention economy - lends the thought\n                that as youth grow with a digital, inherently intangible\n                component to their lives, their private problems and underlying\n                emotions dip further into obscurity. It aligns with my\n                experiences on the local youth council this year as we grapple\n                with confronting contemporary youth issues, which I’ve\n                discovered are more to do with feeling unheard and uncertain\n                than practical problems with visible solutions. It brings to\n                mind this year’s theme of our annual youth week: we are more\n                than you see.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <p>\n            It’s impossible not to consider the role of online platforms in\n            producing this culture of smothered silence.

My own personal assessment of my experiences online,\n            especially as a young artist interested in growing an audience,\n            networking, and reaching others through my work, suggests that the\n            ever-expanding digital universe only makes it easier for our voices\n            to be projected into a vacuum. To be (or arguably more importantly,\n            feel) heard is not simply to have the space to speak, but to be\n            heard above everyone else - and in a digital world which lends to\n            infinitely many voices, a world saturated in noise, we often feel\n            smaller than ever.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>MY INTENT</b> is to present the modern context of youth\n            expression, and a study of its suppression and distortion.
