I also briefly\n            made <b>user personas</b>, but decided not to go forward with them\n            as I didn't feel they added value or focus to my synthesis of the\n            problem, considering they were largely drawn from my user\n            interviews, which were already few in number and focused on a small\n            group of very specific characters.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            My process documentation also suggested that, after my initial\n            brainstorm of changes, I was going to focus on an improved\n            onboarding experience to encourage use or at least understanding of\n            all the app's features. However, after remapping the app's\n            navigation and redesigning the UI to be more intuitive and invite\n            curiosity, I felt that the specific onboarding experience I had\n            originally sketched out seemed less necessary.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Going forward conceptually, I wanted to look into the UI/UX aspect\n            of the design with more depth, and target the fringe users who I\n            weren't able to conduct research with. Specifically, I'd like to\n            revise my design to have better visibility, contrast, and be more\n            friendly towards elderly immigrant patrons with potential language\n            options. Many of the Chinese immigrant grandparents in East Auckland\n            suburbs ride buses frequently, and during one user interview we\n            discussed an instance of another bus rider asking the interviewee to\n            translate the app instructions for her.

I was mostly an artist, who also liked\n                communications and journalism work. It seemed like a last-minute\n                decision I made in Year 13, but in reality, I'd experienced a\n                profound change in how I saw technology, which sparked the\n                trajectory of my new career goals.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Creative software was crucial to my art and design arsenal.\n                Marketing and communications depended on social media. Even\n                keeping connected meant conversations and collaboration online.\n                I viewed softwares as tools which had a great impact on my\n                inspiration and ability to do the things I was passionate about;\n                making art, and uplifting communities.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                This led my pivot to computer science: I want to make digital\n                products which enables others to pursue creativity and hearten\n                their communities too. All the coding stuff? No sweat; I would\n                figure it out in the process, but my destination was defined and\n                set.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                <b>\n                  Canva is doing exactly what I had in mind when I took that\n                  leap of faith into a foreign field, and that's why it's where\n                  I want to be.\n                </b>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div data-aos='fade-up' className='desproj-container'>\n          <img\n            src={canva2}\n            alt=\"2.

The past year has\n                been a lot of reckoning the unfamiliar, but that in itself is\n                nothing new.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Whether it's picking up the bandsaw or creating motion graphics\n                for the first time, I dive right in with the mindset that{' '}\n                <b>I can do it</b>, even if that means expending time and effort\n                to broaden my comfort zone, or not getting it right the first\n                time.

The marriage of\n                these two ideas - of more ‘abstract’ issues often being\n                truncated in their perceived emotional effect, and of public\n                voices dominating the the attention economy - lends the thought\n                that as youth grow with a digital, inherently intangible\n                component to their lives, their private problems and underlying\n                emotions dip further into obscurity.

My own personal assessment of my experiences online,\n            especially as a young artist interested in growing an audience,\n            networking, and reaching others through my work, suggests that the\n            ever-expanding digital universe only makes it easier for our voices\n            to be projected into a vacuum. To be (or arguably more importantly,\n            feel) heard is not simply to have the space to speak, but to be\n            heard above everyone else - and in a digital world which lends to\n            infinitely many voices, a world saturated in noise, we often feel\n            smaller than ever.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>MY INTENT</b> is to present the modern context of youth\n            expression, and a study of its suppression and distortion. Without a\n            physical form our voices and opinions seem brittle, but the\n            simmering emotions beneath the surface must be recognised as equally\n            potent, and equally powerful, as those which take form in riots,\n            vandalism, and violence.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <Socials />\n      <Footer />\n    </main>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Audacity;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/art13.41ea0ffb.jpg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/installation.859e5e8d.png\";","import { React, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport './styles/desproj.css';\nimport cover from './images/work/cofed-thumb.png';\nimport Footer from './components/footer';\nimport Navbar from './components/navbar';\nimport Socials from './components/socials';\nimport AOS from 'aos';\nimport 'aos/dist/aos.css';\n\nconst MyceliYum = () => {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    AOS.init({\n      duration: 1000,\n    });\n  }, []);\n  return (\n    <main className='desproj'>\n      <title>MyceliYum</title>\n      <Navbar />\n\n      <div className='desproj-container'>\n        <div className='desproj-coverimage'>\n          <img src={cover} alt='Cover'></img>\n        </div>\n        <div className='desproj-titlebox'>\n          <div className='desproj-title'>\n            <h5>\n              MyceliYum:\n              <br />\n              Food Co-op Network Portal\n            </h5>\n          </div>\n          <div className='desproj-details'>\n            <h6>Team:</h6>Project led by Bianca Lee and Richard Liu. <br />\n            In collaboration with Eric Hao, Ranon Larpcharern, Jane Lee, Zaid\n            Mamsa, and Claire Thibodeaux. <p />\n            Responsible for collaborative design and software development.\n            <p>\n              <h6>Tools:</h6> React.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Amazon S3\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              <h6>Timeline:</h6> Sep - Dec 2020\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div /* data-aos='fade-up' */ className='desproj-content'>\n          <div className='desproj-tagline'>\n            Linking food and land co-operatives at every point along the food\n            chain.\n          </div>\n          <div className='desproj-container'>\n            <div>\n              <p>\n                As part of our{' '}\n                <a href='https://codebase.berkeley.edu/' target='_blank'>\n                  Berkeley Codebase\n                </a>{' '}\n                mentored project, we partnered with QBPOC-led nonprofit CoFED,\n                an organisation which works with young folks of color from poor\n                and working-class backgrounds to meet communities' needs through\n                food and land co-ops, to produce a web portal which allows\n                co-ops to find each other and collaborate.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                This experience was also my first exposure to web development,\n                specifically using frameworks, packages, and APIs, and a\n                significant exercise in remote collaboration.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <a href='http://cofed.coop' target='_blank'>\n              <img\n                src='https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/themes/5320b56401925b39f3000001/attachments/original/1480552392/logo_blue_new.png?1480552392'\n                alt='CoFED Logo'\n              />\n            </a>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <Socials />\n      <Footer />\n    </main>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyceliYum;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport Home from './Home';\nimport About from './About';\nimport Work from './Work';\nimport ATMobile from './ATMobile';\nimport ProAct from './ProAct';\nimport Canva from './Canva';\nimport Audacity from './Audacity';\nimport { Route, Switch, BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport MyceliYum from './MyceliYum';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <BrowserRouter>\n      <Switch>\n        <Route exact path='/' component={Home} />\n        <Route exact path='/about' component={About} />\n        <Route exact path='/work' component={Work} />\n        <Route exact path='/at-mobile' component={ATMobile} />\n        <Route exact path='/proact' component={ProAct} />\n        <Route exact path='/audacity' component={Audacity} />\n        <Route exact path='/myceliyum' component={MyceliYum} />\n        <Route exact path='/hello-canva!' component={Canva} />\n      </Switch>\n    </BrowserRouter>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\nimport App from \"./App\";\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Router>\n    <App />\n  </Router>,\n  document.getElementById(\"root\")\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
