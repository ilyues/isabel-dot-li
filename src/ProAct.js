            After analysing the brief and posing questions to the charity
            representative, we came to the following conclusion about the
            problem they are facing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, their services struggle to efficiently prioritise
            resources and personnel, i.e. their services:
            <ol>
              <li>Do not respond rapidly enough.</li>
              <li>Do not address victim-specific needs.</li>
              <li>Do not efficiently adapt to rapid developments.</li>
            </ol>

            To determine how to effectively provide support to these children,
            we examined what needed to be done at all stages of the crisis
            response.

            We came up with the following use cases:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Before an event, sentiment analysis is used to predict the
                movement of people and prepare resources and personnel in
                advance.
              </li>
              <li>
                During the event, Twitter and official government data is
                collected to monitor the situation and keep headquarters
                updated.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the initial response, our companion app lets responders
                communicate with headquarters to efficiently provide support
                based on the capacities of safe spaces.

                  We analyse twitter feeds for event-specific tweets. Then,
                  leveraging sentiment analysis we quickly identify ‚Äúnegative‚Äù
                  tweets that indicate a family requires aid. Our platform also
                  pulls updates from government sources to provide HQ with
