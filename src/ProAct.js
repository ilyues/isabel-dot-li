              Our web dashboard and companion mobile app design were produced
              for the 2021 Accenture #HackForGood hackathon challenge. We had 24
              hours to create a product for one of their associated charities,
              Save The Children Australia, and an additional 24 hours to create
              a slide deck before pitching to the judges as a finalist.

            Our assigned client, Save The Children, is a relief provider for
            children affected by disasters. They focus on establishing
            child-friendly spaces in evacuation and recovery centres to ensure
            children receive the crucial support, resources, and comfort they
            need during an emergency, simultaneously relieving parents from the
            responsibility of attending to their child in a high-stress
            situation.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            We were tasked with creating a product which utilised Twitter
            sentiment analysis to aid Save The Children's relief efforts in some
            way ‚Äî problems they gave us included their response speed, accuracy,
            and overall "reactive" (as opposed to proactive) approach.

            After analysing the brief and posing our questions to the charity
            representative through voice call, we identified and categorised
            their main issues into the following pain points:
          </p>
          <span className='desproj-emph'>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The lack of <b>live information</b> about disaster victims'
                situations
              </li>
              <li>
                An inability to evaluate <b>specific needs</b> from victims
              </li>
              <li>
                Poor capacity to <b>monitor and adapt</b> to changing crisis
                situations.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </span>
          <p>
            As a team, we proceeded to separately brainstorm and explore
            solutions, before coming together and deciding to deliver a web
            dashboard and companion app. We created low fidelity wireframes the
            general structure of the web app, before moving to carefully how
            each tab of dashboard features should be categorised and what
            widgets would be most appropriate to showcase.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we moved through iterations, we developed common use cases for
            both responders on the ground and to justify out decisions for the
            major dashboard features. Our final solution provided Save The
            Children the power to:

            To determine how to effectively provide support to these children,

            response.
          </p>
          <p>
            We came up with the following use cases which drove our final
            design:
            <div className='desproj-emph'>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Before the height of a crisis, disaster management at Save the
                  Children can create an event dashboard and use sentiment
                  analysis, individual significant tweets, and government data
                  to
                  <b> predict community movement, locations, and needs</b> in
                  advance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  During the event, <b>live, comprehensive data monitoring</b>{' '}
                  from Twitter and official sources{' '}
                  <b>allow informed decisions</b> for response design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  After initial contact with crisis victims, our companion app
                  lets responders correspond with headquarters to provide
                  <b> real-time, specific feedback on the crisis site</b> and
                  request resources and personnel in a standardised manner.

                Currently, Save the Children's crisis information gathering
                isn't automated; we believe a specific platform to centralise a
                range of useful data and sources for their many disaster
                managers and responders was integral to an organised and
                informed response design.

                  The selection of government and tweet analysis data is
                  gathered and visualised so that:

                    <li>
                      Government information (from the fire service, government
                      twitter, and scraped from government sites) local to the
                      appropriate state or area is streamed to the dashboard.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Quick facts which aid effective response design, such as
                      demographics of the area and evacuation status.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Information is sorted by usefulness to response designers,
                      (such as placing popular tweets about the crisis,
                      suggested to be most urgent or most empathised with by
                      victims, at the top in a designated widget) but can also
                      be personalised by the dashboard user.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Sentiment analysis shows the evolving emotions in response
                      to crisis, offering a passive form of feedback over a
                      longer period of time.

                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  By leveraging sentiment analysis, the dashboard provides sheds
                  light on a neglected but often extremely specific and
                  therefore necessary source of community voices, in an
                  automated manner no less! This creates a holistic view of
                  families in crises by considering reliable, official sources
                  and also community calls for aid.

                  A huge pain point noted by Save the Children was that when
