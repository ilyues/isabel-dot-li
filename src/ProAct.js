              Our web dashboard and companion mobile app design were produced
              for the 2021 Accenture #HackForGood hackathon challenge. We had 24
              hours to create a product for one of their associated charities,
              Save The Children Australia, and an additional 24 hours to create
              a slide deck before pitching to the judges as a finalist.

            Our assigned client, Save The Children, is a relief provider for
            children affected by disasters. They focus on establishing
            child-friendly spaces in evacuation and recovery centres to ensure
            children receive the crucial support, resources, and comfort they
            need during an emergency, simultaneously relieving parents from the
            responsibility of attending to their child in a high-stress
            situation.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            We were tasked with creating a product which utilised Twitter
            sentiment analysis to aid Save The Children's relief efforts in some
            way ‚Äî problems they gave us included their response speed, accuracy,
            and overall "reactive" (as opposed to proactive) approach.

            After analysing the brief and posing our questions to the charity
            representative through voice call, we identified and categorised
            their main issues into the following pain points:
          </p>
          <span className='desproj-emph'>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The lack of <b>live information</b> about disaster victims'
                situations
              </li>
              <li>
                An inability to evaluate <b>specific needs</b> from victims
              </li>
              <li>
                Poor capacity to <b>monitor and adapt</b> to changing crisis
                situations.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </span>
          <p>
            As a team, we proceeded to separately brainstorm and explore
            solutions, before coming together and deciding to deliver a web
            dashboard and companion app. We created low fidelity wireframes the
            general structure of the web app, before moving to carefully how
            each tab of dashboard features should be categorised and what
            widgets would be most appropriate to showcase.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we moved through iterations, we developed common use cases for
            both responders on the ground and to justify out decisions for the
            major dashboard features. Our final solution provided Save The
            Children the power to:

            To determine how to effectively provide support to these children,

          <p>
            We came up with the following use cases:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Before an event, sentiment analysis is used to predict the
                movement of people and prepare resources and personnel in
                advance.
              </li>
              <li>
                During the event, Twitter and official government data is
                collected to monitor the situation and keep headquarters
                updated.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the initial response, our companion app lets responders
                communicate with headquarters to efficiently provide support
                based on the capacities of safe spaces.
              </li>

                  We analyse twitter feeds for event-specific tweets. Then,
                  leveraging sentiment analysis we quickly identify ‚Äúnegative‚Äù
                  tweets that indicate a family requires aid. Our platform also
