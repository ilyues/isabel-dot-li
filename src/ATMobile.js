            As someone who needs public transport to get around my hometown,
            I‚Äôve had my own frustrations using this app to plan and track my
            journeys, often leading to late arrivals or unnecessary anxiety when
            travelling. Knowing this is an issue which may affect a significant
            population of Auckland city, I endeavoured to redesign the UI/UX and
            overall product for a more frictionless commute.

          <p>
            I began very broadly by gathering information available from
            official sources about the user demographic of public transport in
            Auckland. I believed this would be valuable as initial context, and
            act as a starting point so I can break down potential app users into
            main age groups and characters.
          </p>

          <p>
            From analysis of Auckland‚Äôs 2018 census data, I found that in the
            past decade there has been a consistent increase in public transport
            uptake for both journeys to work and to education ‚Äî in 2018
            specifically, the percentage of public transport users totalled to
            14.6%. Breaking this down by age, public transport use to education
            was highest for those over 17, closely followed by the 13-17 age
            range.

          <p>
            <div className='desproj-tagline'>
              These statistics signalled a large portion of public transport
              users to be tertiary students.

          <div className='desproj-subheader'>User Research</div>
          <p>
            Given the limited timeline of this project, I focused on gathering
            information on commuters‚Äô experiences of using the app in two main
            ways:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>User interviews,</b> so I could talk to real users and gain
                an understanding of specific user stories and the different ways
                people use the app to aid their commute. I was also able to
                easily ask follow up questions or discover more about their
                experience in detail.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>App reviews,</b> so I can take a look at a large cross
                section of users and existing complaints and priorities
                specifically regarding the app. I also hoped to find more common
                concerns shared by the app‚Äôs user base.
              </li>
            </ul>
            I decided not to send out user surveys as they wouldn‚Äôt offer any
            different insights to the user interviews, and it would not have
            been a good use of time to create useful surveys, send them out, and
            expect many responses within the one day I had allocated for
            research.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also considered analysis of standalone comments and opinions
            posted on social media such as Twitter or Reddit, but a quick search
            showed that there was limited source material, and that the comments
            I did find were scarce in detail and not particularly meaningful to
            my research.
          </p>
          <div className='desproj-subheader2'>User Interviews</div>

          <div className='desproj-subheader2'>App Reviews</div>
          <p>
            I looked to app reviews on both the Google Play Store and iOS App
            Store to find user input on the app‚Äôs usability. There were many
            vague reviews expressing frustration with the app, as well as some
            indicating gratitude for its usefulness in planning journeys. I
            focused on reviews which noted distinct app features or user
            journeys.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mostly looked for reviews which were recent (submitted in the last
            ~6 months) and therefore relevant to the newest versions of the app,
            as well as reviews which, on the Google Play Store, were rated by
            other users to be representative of their experiences as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            After analysing nearly all the recent reviews, I was able to group
            and identify common concerns, as well as discover new niche problems
            and build a clearer picture of the redesign needs.
